## About Me

I am a third-year undergraduate student with double degrees in Business Analytics and Applied Mathematics at National University of Singapore (NUS), supervised by Prof. [Jonathan Scarlett](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~scarlett/) and Prof. [Vincent Y. F. Tan](https://vyftan.github.io/). 

My Research interests are in the area of Operations Research and Statistical Machine Learning, especially **Bayesian Optimization, Multi-armed Bandit and Probabilistic Graphical Models**. I also have great passion for Probability, Mathematical Statistics, Stochastic Processes and Deep Learning.

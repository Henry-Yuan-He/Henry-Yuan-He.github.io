## About Me
Currently pursuing a Master's in Statistics at the University of Oxford, specializing in Statistical Machine Learning and Operations Research. My interests lie in Time Series Analysis and the Multi-armed Bandit.

Previously, I completed a Double Degree Programme in Business Analytics and Applied Mathematics from the National University of Singapore (NUS) in 2023. I was fortunate to be mentored by Prof. [Jonathan Scarlett](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~scarlett/) and Prof. [Vincent Y. F. Tan](https://vyftan.github.io/).
